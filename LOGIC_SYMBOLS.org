* Introduction
This document explains the three fundamental operations of digital logic:
NOT, AND, and OR.

These operations appear everywhere in electronics, logic gates, FPGA design,
and Boolean algebra.

* NOT operation (¬)
- Symbol: ¬
- Meaning: logical negation
- Description: Inverts the input signal.

| a | ¬a |
|---|----|
| 0 |  1 |
| 1 |  0 |

Examples:
- ¬1 = 0
- ¬0 = 1

In digital circuits: invert a signal.

* AND operation (∧)
- Symbol: ∧
- Meaning: logical AND
- Description: Output is *1* only when *both* inputs are 1.

| a | b | a ∧ b |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   0    |
| 1 | 0 |   0    |
| 1 | 1 |   1    |

In hardware: both conditions must be true for the circuit to activate.

* OR operation (∨)
- Symbol: ∨
- Meaning: logical OR
- Description: Output is 1 if *at least one* input is 1.

| a | b | a ∨ b |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |
| 1 | 1 |   1    |

In hardware: any active input triggers the output.

* XOR operation (exclusive OR)
XOR outputs 1 when *the inputs are different*.

Equivalent Boolean expressions:

1) ¬(a ∧ b) ∧ (a ∨ b)
2) (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b)

Truth table:

| a | b | XOR(a,b) |
|---|---|-----------|
| 0 | 0 |     0     |
| 0 | 1 |     1     |
| 1 | 0 |     1     |
| 1 | 1 |     0     |

* Summary
- ¬   → NOT → inverts the input
- ∧   → AND → 1 only if both inputs are 1
- ∨   → OR  → 1 if at least one input is 1
- XOR → 1 when inputs differ

These symbols form the foundation of digital logic and are essential in FPGA,
CPU design, and Boolean algebra.
